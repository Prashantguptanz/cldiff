# Given two source checklists A and B and an alignment between them,
# compute the merge of the two checklists in the following sense:

# 1. The set of 'merge nodes' form a forest, i.e. every merge node has a
#    merge node as a parent, if it's not a root.
# 2. Every node of the merge comes either from a mutual match between the 
#    sources, or from an unmatched node in either source.
# 3. The second or 'B' checklist has priority in the sense that nodes in the first
#    that conflict with the second are not included in the merge.

# The merge tree is represented by the node-to-parent mapping.  The inverse
# of this mapping (children) is computed on demand.
